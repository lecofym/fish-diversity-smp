## Summary
Worldwide marine ecosystems are facing escalated rates of biodiversity loss thus, Mexico’s government has declared multi-use protected areas with marine portions (area= 8,298,903 ha) to regulate human activities. We aimed to test if there were differences in fish taxonomic and functional diversity among protected reefs within Parque Nacional Huatulco (MPA) and adjacent non-protected (NP) zones, and whether diversity temporal trends displayed by fish communities, commercial and non-commercial groups, relate to partial protection. We hypothesized that fish functional diversity will present spatial resemblance irrespective of whether study sites are located within or outside the MPA, since fishing and tourism activities persist at partially protected reefs; concurrently, we predict a decline in taxonomic and functional diversity, associated with the decrease in commercial species, due to increasing human activities at both zones. We compiled underwater monitoring data performed by SCUBA divers (2006-2020) at 20 coral and rocky reefs (10 MPA and 10 NP sites) to calculate species richness, density, biomass, and functional diversity (based on six biological traits). Functional diversity metrics were used to analyze resemblance among human use levels, while all the ecological indicators were response variables at linear models to assess temporal changes at fish communities, commercial and non-commercial groups. Results showed a high overlap in fish functional structure associated with the persistence of extractive activities at MPA reefs, and the spillover effect toward NP sites. We found significant changes in fish taxonomic and functional diversity that could indicate positive effects of partial protection, such as the increase of functional redundancy and the capacity to maintain reef functions through time. Commercial and non-commercial species showed stability or increases, associated with ecological and social conditions from 2006 to 2020 that led to the conservation of fish assemblages, but it is necessary to evaluate if these patterns will be maintained in the  face of an intense El Niño event in 2023.
